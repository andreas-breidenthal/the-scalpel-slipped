  <div class="prose">
    <p>The Rosarkhiv building on Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street looked exactly like every other Soviet-era institutional structure—grey concrete, narrow windows, the architectural equivalent of bureaucratic indifference.</p>
    <p>I arrived on a Monday morning with a letter of introduction from the Sorbonne, a research visa that had taken six weeks to obtain, and a list of specific file numbers I needed to examine.</p>
    <p>The reading room was on the third floor—a long space with wooden tables, green-shaded lamps, and the smell of old paper and floor wax. Perhaps a dozen other researchers were scattered throughout, bent over documents, taking notes by hand. No laptops allowed. No phones. No cameras without special permission.</p>
    <p>The chief archivist was a woman named Svetlana Makarova—fifties, iron-grey hair pulled back severely, the air of someone who'd spent decades defending rules against people who thought they should be exceptions.</p>
    <p>I presented my research visa and request forms.</p>
    <p>She examined them with the careful attention of a customs inspector looking for contraband.</p>
    <p>"Belgrade Station intelligence reports, 1914," she read aloud. "These are scattered across multiple collections. 'Balkan Affairs,' 'Foreign Ministry Correspondence,' 'Classified Intelligence'—reorganized three times since the revolution. Why do you need these specifically?"</p>
    <p>I'd prepared my answer carefully. "Research on Russian-Serbian relations before the war. I'm examining how intelligence about nationalist movements influenced diplomatic decision-making."</p>
    <p>She grunted, made notes on my form. "These will take time to retrieve. Some may still be classified. You understand this?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"And you understand that not everything requested can be provided? Some files are restricted. Some are lost. Soviet archives are not German archives—we do not have perfect organization."</p>
    <p>"I understand."</p>
    <p>She studied me a moment longer, then nodded. "Return tomorrow. I will see what can be located."</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Svetlana had pulled five folders for me. They sat on the desk when I arrived, each labeled with archival codes I'd memorized from weeks of catalog research.</p>
    <p>"These are what we located," she said. "Two hours maximum per session. No photographs without permission. Notes by hand only."</p>
    <p>I thanked her and sat down, opened the first folder with hands that weren't quite steady.</p>
    <p><em>Foreign Ministry Correspondence, January–April 1914, Balkan Affairs.</em></p>
    <p>I paged through carefully. Standard diplomatic material—trade discussions, reports on Bulgarian politics, assessments of Serbian military capacity. Nothing about the Black Hand. Nothing about threats to Franz Ferdinand. Nothing intelligence-related at all.</p>
    <p>The second folder was similar. Routine correspondence. The third was misfiled—documents from 1912, wrong period entirely. The fourth contained budget reports.</p>
    <p>I was beginning to think this was pointless when I opened the fifth folder.</p>
    <p><em>Provincial Correspondence—Serbia, 1914.</em></p>
    <p>The title was wrong. This wasn't provincial correspondence—it was intelligence summaries, filed under an incorrect heading.</p>
    <p>I turned pages slowly, reading through reports about Serbian politics, economic conditions, military preparations.</p>
    <p>And then I found it.</p>
    <p><em>Report No. 47, dated 2nd April 1914, from Belgrade Station Chief to Foreign Ministry. Subject: Black Hand Operational Capabilities—Assessment Update.</em></p>
    <p>My hands were shaking now.</p>

    <p>I sat there staring at the page, at the stamp, at the handwriting I'd spent two weeks studying.</p>
    <p>He'd received it. He'd read it. He'd acknowledged it. He'd filed it.</p>
    <p>And he'd explicitly noted: <em>no action required.</em></p>
    <p>The recommendation to warn Habsburg authorities—ignored.</p>
    <p>I checked my watch. Forty minutes left in my session. I took out my notebook and began copying the entire document by hand, word for word, every detail.</p>
    <p>When my time expired, Svetlana appeared at my desk.</p>
    <p>"You are finished for today?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. Thank you." I closed the folder, trying to keep my voice neutral. "Tomorrow—would it be possible to access Foreign Ministry classified intelligence files from May and June 1914?"</p>
    <p>She made a note. "I will check what is available. But Dr. Breidenthal—" she paused. "You are not the first person to request materials from this period recently."</p>
    <p>My stomach dropped. "No?"</p>
    <p>"A Russian researcher. Two weeks ago. Same period, 1914 Belgrade Station materials." She looked at me directly. "Why is there sudden interest in these files?"</p>
    <p>"I can't speak for other researchers. For me, it's relevant to my dissertation."</p>
    <p>She nodded slowly, but I could see the calculation in her eyes. She knew something was happening, even if she didn't know what.</p>
    <p>"Tomorrow," she said. "Return at nine."</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>I spent that evening in my hotel room, transcribing my handwritten notes into my laptop, backing them up to three separate cloud services.</p>
    <p>The April 2nd report was exactly what Sazonov had described in his notebook. Word for word, in some passages. This wasn't coincidence. This wasn't parallel documentation.</p>
    <p>The notebook was genuine.</p>
    <p>Sazonov had received intelligence about Black Hand capabilities and threats to Habsburg officials. Had received a specific recommendation to warn Vienna. Had explicitly declined to do so.</p>
    <p>One report proved nothing by itself. But it established that intelligence existed, that warnings were recommended, that decisions were made.</p>
    <p>If I could find the May and June reports Sazonov mentioned—especially the June 10th report with specific details about the Sarajevo visit—it would establish a pattern. Not just one declined recommendation, but systematic withholding of intelligence across months.</p>
    <p>I was uploading the final backup when my phone buzzed.</p>

    <p>I stared at the message. International number, not French or Russian.</p>
    <p>I typed back: <em>Who is this?</em></p>
    <p>No response.</p>
    <p>I sat there for ten minutes, phone in hand, wondering if I was being paranoid or not paranoid enough.</p>
    <p>Someone knew what I was researching. Someone was monitoring archive requests. Someone wanted me to continue but wanted me careful.</p>
    <p>Or someone wanted to make me nervous enough to leave.</p>
    <p>I didn't sleep well that night.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>The next morning, three folders waited at my desk.</p>
    <p>I opened the first one immediately—Foreign Ministry Classified Intelligence, May 1914. More reports from Belgrade Station. Assessments of Serbian political factions. Economic analysis. Nothing about the Black Hand.</p>
    <p>The second folder looked more promising: <em>Threat Assessments—Balkan Region, April–June 1914.</em></p>
    <p>I paged through carefully. And there, filed between reports about Bulgarian territorial ambitions and Romanian military spending, I found it.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Two reports. Two recommendations to coordinate with Habsburg security. Two explicit decisions not to act.</p>
    <p>This was no longer coincidence. This was pattern.</p>
    <p>I was copying the report when I noticed him.</p>
    <p>A man, perhaps mid-thirties, dark hair, wearing an inexpensive suit. He'd been sitting three tables away when I arrived, apparently reading documents from his own research. But now I realized—he wasn't reading. He was watching.</p>
    <p>When I looked directly at him, he looked away. Turned a page in his folder. Made a notation.</p>
    <p>I returned to my copying, but my awareness was split now. Every few minutes I'd glance up. Every time, he was either looking at me or had just looked away.</p>
    <p>After thirty minutes, I stood and walked to the restroom. Counted to sixty. Opened the door a crack.</p>
    <p>He was standing in the corridor, phone to his ear, speaking rapid Russian I couldn't follow.</p>
    <p>I closed the door quietly and stood there, heart pounding.</p>
    <p>I waited another minute, then walked back to the reading room.</p>
    <p>He was at his table again, bent over documents.</p>
    <p>I worked for another hour, copying everything I could from the May report, and when my session ended I packed up quickly and left.</p>
    <p>As I walked down the stairs, I heard footsteps behind me. Not hurrying. Just... following.</p>
    <p>I exited onto Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street and started walking toward the metro. The footsteps continued.</p>
    <p>At the corner, I stopped abruptly and turned.</p>
    <p>He was thirty meters behind, looking at his phone, apparently unconcerned. But he'd stopped when I stopped.</p>
    <p>I turned and continued walking. Descended into the metro. Took the first train that arrived, heading in the wrong direction. Got off three stops later. Changed trains. Changed again.</p>
    <p>When I finally got back to my hotel an hour later, I'd lost him. Or convinced myself I had.</p>
    <p>In my room, I found another text message:</p>
  </div>

<div class="telegram" style="margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius:2px;">
    <div class="tg-meta">

    <p>They know you're looking. They don't want this publicized. Consider leaving Moscow soon.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="prose">
    <p>Different number than before.</p>
    <p>I sat on the bed, looking at my laptop, at my copied notes, at the documentation proving that Sazonov had received warnings and declined to share them.</p>
    <p>I had two choices: leave now with what I'd found, or stay and try to locate the June 10th report—the one with specific details about the Sarajevo visit.</p>
    <p>Leaving meant safety. Staying meant risk.</p>
    <p>But staying meant potentially finding the report that would prove, definitively, that someone had known exactly what was going to happen and had chosen to let it proceed.</p>
    <p>I booked my archive session for the next morning.</p>
    <p>I wasn't leaving until I'd found it.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>I arrived at the archive at nine AM. Svetlana was waiting.</p>
    <p>"Dr. Breidenthal, I apologize. The files you requested yesterday—classified Foreign Ministry intelligence from June 1914—are temporarily unavailable."</p>
    <p>"Unavailable?"</p>
    <p>Her face was carefully neutral. "Undergoing reorganization. Will be several months before they can be accessed."</p>
    <p>"But yesterday you said—"</p>
    <p>"Yesterday I was mistaken about their status." She handed me back my request form, unsigned. "I apologize for the inconvenience."</p>
    <p>Someone had restricted access. Between yesterday afternoon and this morning, someone had decided the June 1914 files should not be available to foreign researchers.</p>
    <p>"Is there anything else I can help you with?" Svetlana asked.</p>
    <p>"No. Thank you."</p>
    <p>I walked out, down the stairs, onto the street. The July sun was already hot. Traffic moved past—cars, buses, pedestrians hurrying to work.</p>
    <p>I stood there, uncertain what to do next.</p>
    <p>An email notification pinged on my phone. From an address I didn't recognize:</p>
