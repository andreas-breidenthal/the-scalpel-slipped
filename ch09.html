    <p>Six months after his dismissal, an offer arrived: Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. The most prestigious posting in Russian diplomacy.</p>
    <p>Sazonov understood immediately.</p>
    <p>This was not elevation. This was removal—away from Russia, away from records, away from anyone who might ask uncomfortable questions. It placed him in London, surrounded by British intelligence, embedded where every conversation would be observed.</p>
    <p>It was brilliant. Cruel, but brilliant.</p>
    <p>Before he could depart, the February Revolution dissolved everything.</p>
    <p>In days—February 23rd to March 3rd—the Romanov dynasty simply evaporated. Nicholas abdicated. The Provisional Government took power. And suddenly all old certainties became irrelevant.</p>
    <p>The Revolution released something more dangerous than mobs: archives.</p>
    <p>As old ministries were seized by revolutionary committees, as files were opened for evidence of "tsarist crimes," Sazonov realized the sanitization he'd performed might not be sufficient.</p>
    <p>He'd destroyed the most incriminating documents. But there were copies, summaries, references in other files. The intelligence system was distributed, redundant. A report sent to St. Petersburg had been filed in Belgrade. A cipher message decoded in the Foreign Ministry had been logged by the telegraph office. A memorandum distributed to three ministers had three copies in three different archives.</p>
    <p>The web was larger than any single burning could eliminate.</p>
    <p>And the Bolsheviks—growing stronger daily—were specifically looking for evidence of "imperialist conspiracy" to justify the war.</p>
    <p>If they found evidence that the tsarist government had known about threats to Franz Ferdinand and chosen not to warn Vienna—proof that intelligence suggesting assassination had been filed rather than shared—it would be propaganda gold.</p>
    <p>Proof the war was not inevitable accident but deliberate imperial calculation.</p>
    <p>Sazonov worked frantically through back-channels to ensure certain files stayed classified, certain archives remained "temporarily unavailable," certain station chiefs who knew too much about Belgrade 1914 were reassigned or quietly retired.</p>
    <p>He met with nervous archivists in empty offices, speaking in low voices about "sensitive materials" and "diplomatic complications" and "information that could damage ongoing negotiations."</p>
    <p>He offered bribes. He called in favors. He used every connection he'd built over decades to ensure that specific files remained lost in bureaucratic limbo.</p>
    <p>But it was like trying to hold back a flood with his hands.</p>
    <p>By May, the situation was untenable.</p>
    <p>The Provisional Government, facing challenges from all sides, canceled the London appointment. A controversial diplomat abroad might become a liability. Too many questions were being asked about the old regime. Too many investigations beginning.</p>
    <p>Sazonov, no longer protected by position or the prospect of prestigious exile, realized he was in danger.</p>
    <p>If the Bolsheviks took power—and increasingly it was clear they would—he would be a target. A symbol of the old regime, of diplomatic failures leading to catastrophic war, of the "imperialist conspiracies" they were certain must exist.</p>
    <p>If they investigated closely, they might find evidence.</p>
    <p>Even if they didn't find it, they might manufacture it.</p>
    <p>In June 1917, Sazonov made the decision to flee.</p>
    <p>The journey south was chaos. Railways were unreliable, controlled by competing factions that changed allegiance daily. Soldiers deserting the front. Peasants seizing estates. The fabric of order unraveling as he watched.</p>
    <p>Sazonov traveled under a false name, carrying only what fit in two bags. He left behind decades of accumulated papers, books, furniture, the material residue of a diplomatic career. His apartment would be seized, inventoried, distributed among the revolutionary masses who saw such places as symbols of aristocratic excess.</p>
    <p>In his pocket, wrapped in oilcloth: the leather-bound notebook with its red pencil marking: <em>Sarajevo</em>.</p>
    <p>He couldn't explain why he'd kept it. It was dangerous, potentially fatal if discovered by the wrong people. If stopped at a checkpoint, if searched by revolutionary guards, if the notebook was opened and someone who read Russian examined it closely...</p>
    <p>But he kept it nonetheless.</p>
    <p>A record of what he'd done, even if no one else would ever see it.</p>
    <p>The journey took three weeks. Through Tula, Orel, Kursk, each city more chaotic than the last. Past burned estates and abandoned villages. Through checkpoints where nervous boys with rifles decided who could pass and who couldn't, their authority derived from nothing more than possession of weapons and willingness to use them.</p>
    <p>Sazonov watched the country he'd served dissolve into fragments, watched the empire he'd tried to expand instead consume itself, and felt the bitter irony of his failure.</p>
    <p>He had positioned Russia to benefit from Habsburg collapse.</p>
    <p>Instead, Russia had collapsed first.</p>
    <p>The vacuum he'd intended to manage had swallowed Russia itself.</p>
    <p>By October, when the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd, Sazonov was in southern Russia, in the temporary headquarters of what would become the White government-in-exile.</p>
    <p>There, in a commandeered hotel in Ekaterinodar, he was given one last appointment: Foreign Minister of the White Russian government.</p>
    <p>It was a title without portfolio, a position without power. The White government controlled no embassies, negotiated no treaties, represented no one beyond shrinking zones where White armies still held ground.</p>
    <p>But it gave him purpose: to convince Western Allies that White Russia deserved support, that intervention would succeed, that restoration was possible.</p>
    <p>Even though he knew it wasn't.</p>
    <p>Even though every report from the front showed White forces losing ground, losing men, losing hope.</p>
    <p>Even though the world had moved on and the old Russia was as dead as the Archduke he'd declined to save.</p>
    <p>In early 1919, he traveled to Paris for the peace conference, carrying credentials from a government that barely existed, representing a cause already lost.</p>
