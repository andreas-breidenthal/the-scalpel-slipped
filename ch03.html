    <p>The dossier on Franz Ferdinand was thinner than the others, yet it carried the weight of a linchpin.</p>
    <p>Sazonov examined the Archduke's photograph on a grey January afternoon, snow falling past his office windows. To most of Europe, Franz Ferdinand was merely Vienna's unpopular heir—abrasive, married to a woman the court barely tolerated. To Nicholas, he represented something more hopeful: a reformer who might stabilize the empire through modernization.</p>
    <p>Sazonov saw what neither Nicholas nor the Archduke's supporters grasped.</p>
    <p>Franz Ferdinand was not a stabilizer. He was a bottleneck—the single point through which all reform must pass, and therefore the single point whose removal would collapse reform's possibility entirely.</p>
    <p>The Archduke's vision of Trialism—elevating Slavs to equal partnership with Germans and Hungarians—offered something Russia could never match: a liberal, Catholic alternative to Orthodox protection. It promised subject peoples autonomy within empire rather than independence through Russian patronage.</p>
    <p>If Franz Ferdinand succeeded, the Balkans would stabilize. Slavic populations would find their future within a reformed Habsburg structure.</p>
    <p>Russia's role as liberator would become obsolete.</p>
    <p>Sazonov set the dossier aside and studied the map pinned to his wall. The contingency memorandum he'd drafted in 1912 depended on Habsburg fragility. Every scenario assumed the empire would fracture under pressure.</p>
    <p>But fracture required weakness at critical points.</p>
    <p>So long as Franz Ferdinand lived and worked toward reform, that weakness didn't exist.</p>
    <p>Sazonov pressed his pen against the dossier's margin, then set it down without marking anything.</p>
    <p>He was not planning assassination. The thought was both absurd and unnecessary. The Balkans were volatile. Serbian nationalism was real, documented, driven by historical grievance. Radical groups operated beyond governmental control.</p>
    <p>Franz Ferdinand was their most visible target.</p>
    <p>It was not a question of whether someone might attempt something. It was a question of when, and whether Vienna's security would be adequate.</p>
    <p>Sazonov thought of a case he'd once read: a doctor who knew a patient was taking poison but chose not to intervene because the patient was an enemy of the state. The doctor hadn't supplied the poison. He'd only declined to mention the antidote.</p>
    <p>What was that doctor guilty of?</p>
    <p>He stood and crossed to the window. The Neva lay frozen, white as blank paper.</p>
    <p>What if Russia knew about threats to Franz Ferdinand and chose not to warn Vienna?</p>
    <p>That would not be causing an assassination. That would be recognizing that history had momentum, and sometimes the statesman's duty was ensuring his nation was prepared when momentum produced results.</p>
    <p>Sazonov returned to his desk and opened his notebook to a fresh page. His pen moved across the paper, then stopped. He read what he'd written:</p>

<div class="private-note">
  <div class="pn-head">Private Notebook · January 1914</div>
  <p>Query: If intelligence indicates threat to Habsburg heir, what is Russia's obligation?</p>
</div>


  <div class="prose">
    <p>He stared at the question for a long moment.</p>
    <p>Then he closed the notebook without answering it.</p>
    <p>The world was not yet broken. Franz Ferdinand still lived, still pursued his reforms, still represented the keystone of Habsburg stability.</p>
    <p>But Sazonov had identified the point where architecture could fail. And unlike other diplomats, who might rush to reinforce that point, he found himself considering a different question:</p>
    <p>What would happen if no warning came?</p>
    <p>He left the question unanswered, hanging in the winter silence.</p>
