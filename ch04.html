    <p>Sazonov read this one more slowly. The recommendation was underlined by the station chief.</p>
    <p>Standard protocol dictated he forward this through back-channels. Not a formal warning—that would suggest Russian intelligence penetration into Serbian affairs—but a subtle heads-up. The sort of thing that happened between rival powers to prevent embarrassments.</p>
    <p>He picked up his pen.</p>
    <p>Set it down again.</p>
    <p>If he warned Vienna, Habsburg security would tighten. Franz Ferdinand's protection would improve. The Archduke would continue his work—federalizing the empire, offering Slavic populations an alternative to Russian protection.</p>
    <p>If he did not warn Vienna, Habsburg security would remain at current levels—adequate for routine situations, insufficient for determined conspirators.</p>
    <p>Sazonov walked to his window. St. Petersburg moved below, indifferent to calculations taking place in the Foreign Ministry.</p>
    <p>He thought about responsibility.</p>
    <p>Surely responsibility meant causing an event—taking action that brought it into being. But he was not taking action. He was declining to prevent action others might take.</p>
    <p>Was that the same thing?</p>
    <p>A doctor who withheld treatment was not the same as a doctor who poisoned a patient. One was neglect. The other was murder.</p>
    <p>But what if the doctor knew the patient would die without treatment, knew he had the cure, and chose not to administer it because the patient's death served his interests?</p>
    <p>Sazonov turned from the window.</p>
    <p>He returned to his desk and drafted a response:</p>

<div class="intel-report">
  <div class="ir-header">
    <span class="ir-from">To: Chief of Station, Belgrade</span>
    <span class="ir-date">From: Foreign Ministry, St. Petersburg</span>
    <span class="ir-class eyes-only">Re: Target Assessment Update · 2nd April 1914</span>
  </div>
  <div class="ir-body">
    <p>Your report noted. Continue monitoring per standard protocols. Regarding recommendation for diplomatic advisory: Habsburg security arrangements remain internal matter for Vienna. Russian interest in Balkan stability best served by maintaining diplomatic distance from Austrian internal security concerns.</p>
    <p>Update only if intelligence indicates state-level threat requiring formal diplomatic engagement.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>He read it over. It said everything and nothing. It acknowledged intelligence without acting on it. It established a policy of non-interference that sounded principled rather than strategic.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, it created a paper trail showing the Foreign Ministry was aware of general threats but had made a considered decision that Habsburg security was Vienna's concern, not St. Petersburg's.</p>
    <p>If anyone ever reviewed these files, they would find a cautious diplomat maintaining appropriate boundaries.</p>
    <p>Not a conspirator enabling assassination.</p>
    <p>Sazonov signed it and watched the clerk encode it for cipher transmission.</p>
    <p>Then he returned to the drawer and pulled out all three reports. He read them in sequence, seeing the pattern: capability, weaponry, targeting.</p>
    <p>The framework was building itself. Not Russian framework—Serbian framework. Built by men Russia could observe but not control.</p>
    <p>Or so the official position would be.</p>
    <p>He locked the reports away and sat in his office, aware that he'd crossed a threshold.</p>
    <p>He was no longer merely observing Europe's fragility. He was ensuring that fragility would not be reinforced before it fractured.</p>
    <p>But this was still preparation, not causation. Strategy, not crime.</p>
    <p>The logic was sound. Habsburg security was Vienna's responsibility. Russian intervention would create diplomatic complications. These were sufficient reasons.</p>
