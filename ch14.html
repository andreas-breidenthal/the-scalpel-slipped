    <p>The bookshop was the kind you find by accident—tucked down a narrow alley in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, single grimy window, the smell of old paper and mildew and time itself, if time has a smell.</p>
    <p>I'd been there maybe twenty minutes, running my fingers along spines, reading titles in the dim afternoon light. I was supposed to be on holiday. A week away from my doctorate, from archives and footnotes, from the small apartment in the 5th where I'd been slowly going mad with revision notes. Three years into researching German-Russian diplomatic relations before the First World War, I needed distance from it.</p>
    <p>The shop owner—weathered face, late sixties, the look of someone who'd spent his life outdoors before retiring to this cave of forgotten literature—was unpacking a box near the counter. Estate sale, probably. Someone had died and their library was being liquidated, reduced to bulk lots sold by the kilo.</p>
    <p>I watched him stack volumes with practiced efficiency. Paperback thrillers. Water-damaged encyclopedias. Philosophy texts. Nothing remarkable.</p>
    <p>Then, as he lifted two novels simultaneously, a thin booklet slipped out from between them and landed with a soft thud at his feet.</p>
    <p>He groaned—the sound of a man whose knees had betrayed him long ago—and stooped to pick it up.</p>
    <p>From where I stood, perhaps three meters away, it looked like an old leather-bound notebook. The cover was worn smooth, the color of tobacco, with no title or marking visible.</p>
    <p>He held it up to the light, squinting, then flipped it open and grunted.</p>
    <p>Our eyes met across the shop. He gave a wry smile and shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Cyrillic scribble," he said in French, his accent thick with the regional vowels of Provence. Then he tossed it casually toward a waste bin in the corner.</p>
    <p>The notebook missed—his aim was as tired as his knees—and slid under a nearby shelf.</p>
    <p>He didn't bother retrieving it. Just returned to unpacking his box, already forgotten.</p>
    <p>I continued browsing, working my way down the far side of the shelves, but my attention was divided. Cyrillic. Russian. Old leather binding. The combination nagged at something in my historian's brain—the part that's always alert for primary sources, for documents that might contain something unexpected.</p>
    <p>Probably nothing. Probably some émigré's diary, mundane notes about weather and prices and complaints about the French. The Côte d'Azur had been full of White Russians after the revolution. They'd died here in their thousands through the twenties and thirties, leaving behind photographs and samovars and notebooks in a language their French neighbors couldn't read.</p>
    <p>Still.</p>
    <p>When I reached the end of the aisle, I saw the notebook had slid completely through to the other side. I crouched and picked it up.</p>
    <p>The leather was soft with age, the binding tight but not stiff. I opened it carefully, conscious that old books could disintegrate if handled roughly.</p>
    <p>The pages were covered in neat Cyrillic handwriting. The script was educated, fluid, written with a fountain pen that had left faint impressions in the paper. I flipped through slowly, watching dates appear in the margins.</p>
    <p><em>1917</em></p>
    <p><em>1916</em></p>
    <p><em>1915</em></p>
    <p><em>1914</em></p>
    <p>The entries grew more frequent as I went backward in time. Then the notebook fell open to a page marked with a faded red pencil line.</p>
    <p>At the top of the page, underlined twice: <em>Sarajevo.</em></p>
    <p>My heart rate picked up.</p>
    <p>I'd spent three years studying the July Crisis of 1914. I knew every diplomatic telegram, every memorandum, every account of those five weeks when Europe stumbled into catastrophe. I'd read Sazonov's published memoirs twice, cross-referenced them with German and Austrian sources, written papers on the mobilization crisis and the failure of deterrence.</p>
    <p>And here, in a notebook that had nearly ended up in a waste bin, was someone's private writing about Sarajevo, dated to the period, written in Russian.</p>
    <p>I turned more pages. Dates jumped out at me: <em>10th June 1914. 2nd April 1914. February 1912.</em> Names I recognized: <em>Nicholas. Franz Ferdinand. Belgrade Station.</em></p>
    <p>Phrases that made my hands tremble slightly:</p>
    <p><em>"intelligence that had been arriving since April"</em></p>
    <p><em>"recommendations declined"</em></p>
    <p><em>"the phone call I didn't make"</em></p>
    <p>I closed the notebook and stood there in the dusty shop, holding what might be nothing or might be something extraordinary, while the owner continued unpacking books and humming tunelessly to himself.</p>
    <p>I approached the counter.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me. The notebook—the one you threw away. How much?"</p>
    <p>He looked up, surprised. "The Russian one? You read Russian?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>He shrugged. "Two euros."</p>
    <p>I pulled out my wallet, extracted a five-euro note. "Keep the change."</p>
    <p>He took it without comment, made no receipt, no record. Just pocketed the money and returned to his unpacking.</p>
    <p>I walked out into the warm summer evening, the notebook in my hand, my heart beating too fast.</p>
    <p>The sun was setting over the medieval walls of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, turning everything golden. Tourists strolled past, speaking English and German and Japanese, photographing the views, the flowers, the picturesque decay of old Europe.</p>
    <p>I found a bench in a small square and sat down. Opened the notebook again. Started reading more carefully.</p>
    <p>The handwriting was consistent throughout—the same person, writing over a span of years. The earliest entries were analytical, discussing diplomatic frameworks and European power structures with the detached precision of a foreign ministry professional.</p>
    <p>Then entries from 1914, becoming increasingly detailed. Intelligence reports. Dates. Specific warnings about threats to Habsburg officials.</p>
    <p>And later entries—1916, 1917—written in a different tone entirely. Confessional. Guilty. Retrospective.</p>
    <p><em>"I had known. I had chosen silence."</em></p>
    <p>I turned to the front of the notebook, looking for a name, an identification, anything.</p>
    <p>On the inside cover, in faded ink, almost illegible: <em>S.D. Sazonov, 1912.</em></p>
    <p>Sergei Dmitrievich Sazonov.</p>
    <p>Russian Foreign Minister, 1910–1916.</p>
    <p>The man who'd positioned Russia for the July Crisis, who'd advised Nicholas II, who'd overseen the mobilization that triggered the German declaration of war.</p>
    <p>I'd read his published memoirs. Studied his diplomatic correspondence. Written twenty pages about his role in the crisis.</p>
    <p>And now I was holding what appeared to be his private journal.</p>
    <p>I sat on that bench until darkness fell, reading and re-reading, trying to understand what I had. The medieval walls of the village glowed amber in the lamplight. Somewhere in the alleys behind me, a restaurant was filling with noise and laughter.</p>
    <p>I was barely aware of any of it.</p>
    <p>Because if this notebook was genuine—if Sazonov had really documented receiving intelligence about threats to Franz Ferdinand, and deliberately chosen not to share it—then the entire established narrative of how the Great War began was incomplete.</p>
    <p>History said the war was inevitable. Alliance systems, mobilization schedules, structural forces pushing everyone into war. Nobody wanted it, nobody could stop it. Structural inevitability.</p>
    <p>That narrative came from diplomatic telegrams, published memoirs, official documents—sources that had been sanitized, reviewed, approved for public consumption.</p>
    <p>What if the truth had been carried in private notebooks, burned in fireplaces, destroyed by men who knew what they'd done couldn't be defended?</p>
    <p>By the time the train pulled into Gare de Lyon at 6:47 AM, I'd made a decision: authenticate properly, using every tool available. If it was a forgery, I'd know within a week.</p>
    <p>If it was genuine, I had a choice to make.</p>
    <p>But first: authentication.</p>
