    <p>Two years into the war, Sazonov received the summons.</p>
    <p>The Brusilov Offensive—promised as breakthrough—had collapsed into familiar horror. Hundreds of thousands dead for kilometers of mud that would be lost by autumn. Food riots in Petrograd were routine now. The Duma questioned the Tsar's competence openly. And the Tsarina, increasingly under Rasputin's influence, saw enemies everywhere.</p>
    <p>Sazonov had become one.</p>
    <p>"The Empress believes your continued service is no longer beneficial," Nicholas said, not meeting his eyes. They stood in the same study where, two years earlier, Sazonov had persuaded the Tsar that Russia must be prepared for crisis. "She feels new leadership might bring fresh perspective."</p>
    <p>It was Alexandra's doing—the Tsarina had long distrusted Sazonov's intellect, his secular approach. But Nicholas's willingness to act on her advice spoke volumes about how completely the Tsar had surrendered. The war had broken something in him. He no longer made decisions—he agreed with whoever spoke last.</p>
    <p>"I serve at Your Majesty's pleasure," Sazonov said.</p>
    <p>"You'll be compensated appropriately. But effective immediately, your duties are concluded."</p>
    <p>There was no mention of positioning before the war. No acknowledgment of frameworks built, intelligence withheld, choices that led to this moment.</p>
    <p>Nicholas had either forgotten or chosen to forget.</p>
    <p>Perhaps he had never fully understood.</p>
    <p>Sazonov bowed and withdrew.</p>
    <p>Back in his office—which would no longer be his within days—he sat at the desk where he'd made so many calculations, positioned so carefully for the crisis he'd enabled but not caused.</p>
    <p>The irony was complete: dismissed not for what he'd actually done, but for failures that followed, for the war he'd never wanted, for catastrophe that had escaped his framework entirely.</p>
    <p>No one suspected the real crime.</p>
    <p>No one looked for intelligence reports in drawers.</p>
    <p>No one asked whether the Foreign Minister who'd positioned so carefully might have received warnings he chose not to share.</p>
    <p>History would record that Sergei Sazonov served competently until the war's strain required new leadership.</p>
    <p>It would not record that he had helped create conditions for that war.</p>
    <p>Because no one knew to look.</p>
    <p>As he cleared his desk, Sazonov faced the drawer only he could open.</p>
    <p>He stared at it for a long moment.</p>
    <p>Then he removed every document—every intelligence report, every contingency memorandum, every piece of systematic preparation.</p>
    <p>The office had a fireplace, rarely used but functional. He lit it now.</p>
    <p>He fed the papers in slowly. The intelligence reports from Belgrade Station, curling into ash. The contingency frameworks for Habsburg partition, blackening. His personal notes about choosing not to warn Vienna, disappearing into smoke.</p>
    <p>Each page he burned felt like erasure of more than paper. These were the only records that his calculations had been real, that his framework had existed. Without them, he was simply a diplomat who'd made reasonable decisions in unreasonable times.</p>
    <p>With them, he was something else entirely.</p>
    <p>He watched the flames consume two years of systematic preparation. The March report—gone. The April recommendation—gone. The June 10th intelligence with its specific details about Sarajevo—gone.</p>
    <p>What remained in the files would be sanitized: routine correspondence, standard intelligence summaries, nothing suggesting Russia had known anything specific or positioned beyond normal prudence.</p>
    <p>The record was clean.</p>
    <p>The truth was ash.</p>
    <p>He stirred the ashes with the poker until they were unrecognizable, then stood watching the embers fade.</p>
    <p>Only one document remained—the leather-bound notebook he carried everywhere, with its red pencil marking the page: <em>Sarajevo</em>.</p>
    <p>He pulled it from his pocket and opened it. Beyond that marking were his notes from 1912 through 1914. The framework. The positioning. The intelligence reports summarized. The dates he'd chosen not to act.</p>
    <p>All of it there, in his own hand.</p>
    <p>Sazonov carried the notebook to the fireplace. The embers still glowed faintly. He could drop it in now. Watch it catch. End this completely.</p>
    <p>His hand hovered over the opening.</p>
    <p>But he couldn't do it.</p>
    <p>This was the only proof that he had not been simply buffeted by events. That he had tried—however catastrophically—to shape them. That his mind had worked, his calculations had been real, his framework had existed.</p>
    <p>Without this notebook, the truth died completely.</p>
    <p>With it, some record survived—even if no one else would ever see it.</p>
    <p>He wasn't sure which version of history he wanted.</p>
    <p>Or which version of himself.</p>
    <p>Sazonov closed the fireplace grate and slipped the notebook into his coat pocket. Then he left the Foreign Ministry for the last time.</p>
    <p>On the street, Petrograd continued its wartime routines. Soldiers on leave, faces hollow with what they'd seen. Women in black, mourning husbands, sons, brothers. Queues for bread and coal stretching around corners. The city looked worn, on the edge of something worse than war.</p>
    <p>Sazonov hailed a cab and gave his home address.</p>
    <p>He had committed what he now understood was a crime—not legally perhaps, but morally. He had known a man would be murdered and declined to prevent it. He had positioned his nation to exploit tragedy before it occurred. He had built frameworks that assumed catastrophe and prepared to benefit from it.</p>
    <p>And now all evidence was gone.</p>
    <p>Burned.</p>
    <p>As though it had never existed.</p>
    <p>History would never know.</p>
    <p>Sazonov should have felt relief.</p>
    <p>Instead, he felt a hollowness that threatened to consume him. Because without evidence, without witnesses, without record, the only person who would ever carry the weight of his choices was himself.</p>
    <p>And that weight might be more than he could bear.</p>
    <p>The cab rattled through streets that looked increasingly unfamiliar, as though the city itself was becoming foreign to him. Or perhaps he was becoming foreign to it—a man carrying secrets from a world that no longer existed, unable to speak them, unable to forget them.</p>
    <p>As they passed the Winter Palace, he saw more crowds gathering. Angry faces. Raised fists. The same energy that had demanded action in July 1914 now demanded something else—change, revolution, an end to the war that had consumed everything.</p>
    <p>The war he had helped begin.</p>
    <p>The cab turned onto his street and Sazonov looked away from the crowds, away from the city, focusing on nothing.</p>
    <p>In two years, he would have to flee this place entirely.</p>
    <p>But the weight he carried would follow him wherever he went.</p>
