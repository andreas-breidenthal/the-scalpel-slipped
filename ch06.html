    <p>The Foreign Ministry had gone quiet in the way buildings do when history is about to change hands.</p>
    <p>Almost four weeks had passed since Sarajevo. Almost four weeks of shocked condolences, careful positioning, waiting for Vienna's response. Now it had arrived.</p>
    <p>Sazonov stood at the threshold of his office as a clerk approached, carrying a sealed dispatch on a silver tray.</p>
    <p>"From Vienna," the man said. "Arrived this morning."</p>
    <p>Sazonov dismissed him and broke the seal.</p>
    <p>The Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia lay before him—not a diplomatic instrument, but a legal trap. Twenty-four demands, numbered with Prussian precision. Each clause fitted too neatly into the next. Each concession required another until compliance became indistinguishable from capitulation.</p>
    <p>Forty-eight hours to respond.</p>
    <p>Sazonov set the pages down carefully.</p>
    <p>He had anticipated severity. Even brutality. What he had not anticipated was engineering. This document had been constructed with a purpose that transcended Austrian revenge. It was designed not to be negotiated, but to be refused—and to justify whatever came after.</p>
    <p>He picked it up again, reading for cadence rather than content. Something in the rhythm troubled him. The language was sharp where it should have been ceremonial. Vienna, when it threatened, tended to threaten slowly, with excess justification.</p>
    <p>This was different. This was steel dressed as law.</p>
    <p>A thought surfaced, unwelcome: <em>This is too clean.</em></p>
    <p>For weeks, he'd worked to create pressure without rupture. A tightening that could still be guided. What lay on his desk did not tighten.</p>
    <p>It snapped.</p>
    <p>He pressed his thumb against the margin, leaving a faint crescent in the paper.</p>
    <p>Somewhere, a line had been crossed—but not by Vienna alone. This felt instructed, shaped to perform a function rather than express a grievance.</p>
    <p>And Sazonov, staring at the document, understood: he had not been the only one positioning for Habsburg collapse.</p>
    <p>Someone else had looked at the same vacuum and filled it with something cruder than diplomatic partition.</p>
    <p>He lifted the telephone receiver. "Tsarskoye Selo."</p>
    <p>The line passed through deferential pauses before an adjutant spoke. "His Majesty will convene the Council at dawn."</p>
    <p>Dawn. Sazonov replaced the receiver.</p>
    <p>He began drafting instructions—not for policy, but for containment. Which files should be relocated. Which correspondence misfiled. Which memoranda should vanish into bureaucratic chaos.</p>
    <p>History would come soon enough. When it did, it would find a ministry caught off guard, reacting rather than directing. It would find a Foreign Minister who had observed structural fragilities but had not caused them to collapse.</p>
    <p>It would not find the drawer he kept locked.</p>
    <p>The one containing intelligence reports from Belgrade Station marked "Black Hand activities—recommend Vienna advisory."</p>
    <p>Reports he had received in April, May, June.</p>
    <p>Reports he had never forwarded.</p>
    <p>He should feel something—regret, guilt, horror at what he'd enabled. Instead, he felt only the cold clarity of recognition: the framework he'd built had been seized by others and weaponized beyond his design.</p>
    <p>At Tsarskoye Selo he would argue for restraint. He would present himself as the voice of reason in an unreasonable moment.</p>
    <p>He already knew how the argument would end.</p>
    <p>At the door, he glanced once more at the ultimatum. Forty-eight hours.</p>
    <p>His careful positioning had become someone else's weapon. What he'd intended to hold had been taken from his hands and used for purposes he had never imagined.</p>
    <p>The Ministry hummed with urgent quiet, unaware that the irrevocable had already begun.</p>
    <p>And Sazonov walked among the clerks, feeling the weight of a truth he could never speak: that the instrument he'd designed to guide had instead become the mechanism that ensured no one could stop what was coming.</p>
