    <p>Sergei Dmitrievich Sazonov served as Foreign Minister of Imperial Russia from 1910 to 1916. He was dismissed during wartime reorganization and lived in exile in France after the Bolshevik Revolution. His published memoirs, <em>Fateful Years</em> (1928), provide valuable insight into Russian diplomatic thinking before the Great War, but they are notably reticent about intelligence operations and internal decision-making processes.</p>

    <p><strong>What is documented:</strong> The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo (28th June 1914); the existence of Serbian nationalist organizations including the Black Hand; Russian diplomatic and military positioning during the July Crisis; Habsburg security failures on the day of the assassination; the alliance system and mobilization schedules that contributed to war; Sazonov's dismissal (1916), exile, and death in Nice (1927).</p>

    <p><strong>What is invented:</strong> The private notebook and its specific contents; intelligence reports from Belgrade Station warning of threats to Franz Ferdinand; the "Sazonov Protocol" as deliberate framework for exploiting Habsburg crisis; specific foreknowledge of assassination plans; documents proving deliberate withholding of warnings.</p>

    <p>No historical evidence exists that Russia received specific intelligence about threats to Franz Ferdinand, or that warnings were deliberately withheld from Habsburg authorities. The intelligence reports, internal memoranda, and private confessions depicted in this novel are fictional.</p>

    <p>However, the questions raised are historically legitimate. Intelligence services in 1914 did monitor nationalist movements. Information-sharing between rival powers was inconsistent and often politically motivated. The gap between what governments knew and what they acted upon remains debated by historians. Whether the assassination could have been prevented with better intelligence coordination is unknowable.</p>

    <p>For readers interested in the historical background, the following works provide essential context:</p>
    <p>Christopher Clark, <em>The Sleepwalkers</em> (2012) — the most comprehensive account of how Europe stumbled into war, and the source of the "sleepwalkers" metaphor for leaders who didn't grasp what they were doing.</p>
    <p>Margaret MacMillan, <em>The War That Ended Peace</em> (2013) — a panoramic account of the decade before 1914, focused on the decisions and personalities that made war possible.</p>
    <p>Sean McMeekin, <em>July 1914: Countdown to War</em> (2013) — a day-by-day reconstruction of the five weeks between Sarajevo and war, drawing on archives across Europe.</p>
    <p>Dominic Lieven, <em>Toward the Flame: Empire, War, and the End of Tsarist Russia</em> (2016) — a study of Russian decision-making in 1914, sympathetic to the difficulties facing Russian leaders but clear-eyed about the consequences.</p>
    <p>The archival documents referenced in Part III—Vienna provincial security assessments, Russian Foreign Ministry correspondence, Belgrade Station intelligence summaries—are real categories of documents that exist in these archives, though the specific documents described are fictional reconstructions based on the types of materials governments of the period produced.</p>
