    <p>The telegram arrived at 1:47 PM.</p>
    <p>A clerk burst into the budget meeting, his face drained of color. He held a slip of paper like it might burn him.</p>
    <p>"From Vienna," he managed. "Urgent."</p>
    <p>Sazonov took it without expression, read it once, then looked up at the assembled ministers. "Gentlemen, we'll need to adjourn."</p>
    <p>They filed out in uncertain silence. Only when the door closed did Sazonov allow himself to read it again:</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>He stood and walked to the window. Below, the Neva moved dark and slow through the afternoon heat. Carriages rattled over cobblestones. A vendor called out, selling kvass. The ordinary machinery of a Sunday afternoon, continuing as though the world hadn't just pivoted.</p>
    <p>His hands were steady. His breathing measured. His mind already moving through contingencies he'd prepared—mobilization protocols, diplomatic channels, coordination mechanisms.</p>
    <p>All of it ready.</p>
    <p>All of it waiting.</p>
    <p>A knock. The clerk again, even paler.</p>
    <p>"Foreign Minister. A second telegram."</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Sazonov read it twice.</p>
    <p>Dead. Not wounded. Dead.</p>
    <p>Something moved through him—not quite relief, not quite satisfaction. Something colder. The feeling a surgeon might have when the incision proves exactly where expected, when the anatomy matches the textbook diagram.</p>
    <p>Two years of careful positioning. Two years of frameworks and contingencies. Two years of mapping Europe's fracture lines.</p>
    <p>And now the keystone was gone.</p>
    <p>He should call Tsarskoye Selo immediately. Nicholas would need to hear this personally, not through channels. The Tsar would be shocked. Horrified. He would cross himself and murmur prayers.</p>
    <p>Sazonov reached for the telephone, then stopped.</p>
    <p>First, a different matter.</p>
    <p>He unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk—the one he opened alone, after hours, when clerks had gone home. Inside were files marked with classifications that routed only to him: Belgrade Station reports, capability assessments, threat matrices.</p>
    <p>Intelligence that had been arriving since April.</p>
    <p>Intelligence that had grown increasingly specific through May and June.</p>
    <p>Intelligence that had never been forwarded to Vienna.</p>
    <p>Sazonov didn't remove the files. He simply looked at them, confirming they were still there, still secure. Then he locked the drawer again.</p>
    <p>When historians examined this day—and they would—they would find a Foreign Ministry caught off guard. They would find a minister reacting to unexpected tragedy, scrambling to manage crisis no one had foreseen.</p>
    <p>They would not find this drawer.</p>
    <p>They would not find the intelligence reports marked "recommend Vienna advisory."</p>
    <p>They would not find the choices made in April, May, June—the careful decisions, the systematic silence.</p>
    <p>Now he lifted the telephone receiver. The operator connected him through three exchanges to Tsarskoye Selo.</p>
    <p>"His Majesty must be informed immediately," Sazonov said. "The Archduke is dead."</p>
    <p>While he waited for Nicholas to come to the line, Sazonov looked out at St. Petersburg, at the city moving through its Sunday afternoon, unaware that the world it knew was already gone.</p>
    <p>When had positioning crossed into causing?</p>
    <p>To understand that, one must return to a winter night two years earlier, when the architecture of catastrophe was still only possibility, and the man who would help build it believed he could control what he was creating.</p>
