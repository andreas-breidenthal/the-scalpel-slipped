    <p>The Foreign Ministry after midnight was no longer a place of policy. It was a place of clarity.</p>
    <p>Sergei Sazonov preferred it this way. Decisions made in daylight were compromised by performance—the need to explain, to justify, to account for witnesses. Decisions made alone, in the green-shaded lamplight of an empty office, answered only to logic.</p>
    <p>Three folders lay on his desk, aligned with deliberate care. Not labeled by treaty or nation, but by capital: <em>Berlin. Vienna. St. Petersburg</em>. Inside were not plans but profiles—habits, anxieties, remembered humiliations, notes from conversations never committed to official record.</p>
    <p>Sazonov was fifty-one years old, educated at the Alexander Lyceum where Russia's administrative elite learned that the world was an unstable instrument requiring expert management. He had spent his career watching empires from the inside: London's arithmetic of power, Rome's patience, Vienna's exhaustion. He understood that Europe was not a collection of states but a failing structure, and that the man who mapped its weaknesses might position his nation for the moment of collapse.</p>
    <p>If collapse came.</p>
    <p>When collapse came.</p>
    <p>The distinction mattered.</p>
    <p>He opened the Berlin folder first.</p>
    <p>Wilhelm II did not require persuasion. He required validation. The Kaiser's vanity was kinetic—impatient, theatrical, hungry for recognition. Present him with the prospect of German influence over Austria-Hungary's industrial regions, frame it as destiny rather than aggression, and Wilhelm would supply momentum willingly. He would mistake ambition for vision.</p>
    <p>Sazonov made a note: <em>Does not seek governance through force. Would accept it if achieved diplomatically.</em></p>
    <p>The Vienna folder was more complex.</p>
    <p>Franz Josef was dying slowly, his empire dying with him. Sixty-three years on the throne had taught him that holding contradictions together was nobler than solving them. But exhaustion, once acknowledged, could feel like permission. A sharp enough crisis in the Balkans would collapse choice into necessity. Faced with internal dissolution, the old Emperor might accept external "management" as the least terrible option.</p>
    <p>Sazonov wrote one word in the margin: <em>Fatigue.</em></p>
    <p>The St. Petersburg folder he saved for last.</p>
    <p>Nicholas II was volatile precisely because he believed himself moral. Duty weighed on him—to dynasty, to faith, to the Slavs who looked east for protection. Frame action as responsibility rather than ambition, and Nicholas would commit. Make inaction feel like betrayal, and he would authorize anything.</p>
    <p>Sazonov recognized this not as manipulation but as translation. The Tsar did not need to be driven. He needed to see that what he already wanted to do was also what he ought to do.</p>
    <p>The elegance of the framework taking shape lay in its economy. Nothing required invention. Vanity would supply force. Fatigue would eliminate alternatives. Duty would ensure commitment.</p>
    <p>Sazonov drew three interlocking arcs on a blank page. Incomplete alone. Decisive when engaged together.</p>
    <p>War appeared nowhere in the diagram.</p>
    <p>War was crude, unpredictable. What he was designing was a framework for recognizing how pressure—if it emerged naturally—would flow along predictable paths. How fracture, if it occurred, could be guided rather than feared.</p>
    <p>He was not creating instability.</p>
    <p>He was mapping where it already existed.</p>
    <p>An hour after midnight, Sazonov crossed to the window. St. Petersburg looked immutable from above—a useful illusion. He knew better. Structures endured only as long as their load-bearing points held.</p>
    <p>When he returned to the desk, he opened a fresh page and wrote a heading:</p>
    <p><em>Contingency Memorandum: Habsburg Fracture Scenarios</em></p>
    <p>He did not sign it. Not yet. This was not a document meant to be found—or, if found, meant to be understood as anything more than prudent planning.</p>
    <p>Three hours later, when he finally extinguished the lamp, he had created something that existed in the space between observation and action. A framework that could claim to be purely analytical until the moment it was used.</p>
    <p>And in that ambiguity lay both its power and its danger.</p>
    <p>But Sazonov, walking through the empty corridors toward the waiting carriage, felt only satisfaction.</p>
    <p>He had not caused anything.</p>
    <p>He had simply prepared for what history might provide.</p>
    <p>These were sufficient reasons.</p>
