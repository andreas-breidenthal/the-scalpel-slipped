    <p>The article was published in March 2026.</p>
    <p>The response was exactly what Professor Duval had predicted: immediate, polarizing, overwhelming.</p>
    <p>Academic journals requested follow-up articles. News outlets wanted interviews. Conferences invited me to present. The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling the notebook "unverified and historically misleading." German historians debated whether this vindicated or complicated their understanding of war guilt.</p>
    <p>I received death threats from nationalist groups and enthusiastic emails from students fascinated by the discovery. Professor Reinhardt in Vienna published a supportive article. Historians in Moscow published rebuttals.</p>
    <p>My dissertation defense was postponed because the committee couldn't separate the scholarly quality of my work from the political firestorm surrounding it.</p>
    <p>I became, for a brief moment, exactly what I'd feared: famous for one discovery, defined by one article, caught in debates I hadn't intended to trigger.</p>
    <p>But I also received a letter from an elderly woman in Lyon—a great-granddaughter of someone who'd died at Verdun. She wrote:</p>

  <div class="pn-head">Letter received from Lyon, March 2026</div>
  <p>Thank you for revealing this. My great-grandfather died believing the war was inevitable. Now I know it wasn't. That someone had information that might have prevented it, and chose not to share it. This doesn't bring him back. But it means his death wasn't just random misfortune. There were choices. People made them. Knowing that matters.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>I kept that letter on my desk, next to Sazonov's notebook, which I'd donated to the Bibliothèque nationale de France with the stipulation that it remain publicly accessible.</p>
    <p>Some nights I wonder if I made the right choice. If the nationalist propaganda, the diplomatic tensions, the historical revisionism—if all of that outweighs the value of historical truth.</p>
    <p>Other nights I think about Sazonov dying in Nice, whispering confession to no one, the truth locked in his chest along with his failing heart.</p>
    <p>And I'm glad I didn't carry that weight.</p>
    <p>History may judge whether my publication was responsible scholarship or career-motivated sensationalism. Whether revealing Sazonov's choices served justice or just served controversy.</p>
    <p>But at least history can judge.</p>
    <p>Because the evidence exists now. The questions are being asked. The comfortable narrative of inevitable accident has been complicated by uncomfortable evidence of enablement.</p>
    <p>That's not closure. It's not redemption. It's not even certainty—we'll never know if warnings would have prevented the assassination, if prevention would have prevented the war.</p>
    <p>But it's honest.</p>
    <p>And honesty, I've learned, is all history can really offer.</p>
    <p>The notebook sits now in a climate-controlled vault in Paris, available to any researcher who requests it. The archival documents I found have been published in multiple languages. The debate continues about what they mean, what Sazonov intended, whether his choices constitute crime or statecraft.</p>
    <p>I don't know the answers to those questions.</p>
    <p>But I know this: Sazonov stood at a telephone in June 1914 and chose not to make a call. That choice had consequences that rippled across the twentieth century.</p>
    <p>I sat at a laptop in September 2025 and chose to click Send. That choice has consequences that are still unfolding.</p>
    <p>We were both historians, in our way. Both positioned to reveal or conceal. Both forced to choose between truth and its complications.</p>
    <p>He chose silence.<br>—I chose speech.</p>
    <p>And the difference between us—the only difference that matters:</p>
    <p>I can live with my choice.<br>—He died trying to escape his.</p>
