    <p>Two months passed. Spring turned to early summer. Reports continued from Belgrade Station—some routine, some concerning, all filed according to the protocol Sazonov had established.</p>
    <p>Vienna remained unwarned.</p>
    <p>Then, on June 10th, the final report arrived.</p>

    <p>Black Hand operational preparation confirmed. Intercepts reference major action during Habsburg ceremonial calendar. Multiple references to 'Kosovo day' and 'removing the obstacle.' Target assessment: senior Habsburg officials, likely Archduke during announced Sarajevo visit.</p>
    <p>Date: 28th June (Vidovdan). Method: Multiple operatives positioned along probable motorcade route. Weapons: small arms, grenades.</p>
    <p>Capability: HIGH. Success probability: MODERATE TO HIGH given symbolic date and operational environment.</p>
    <p>CRITICAL: Operational timeline suggests attack will proceed regardless of external factors. Group commitment appears absolute.</p>

    <p class="ir-rec">Immediate diplomatic advisory to Habsburg authorities. Security enhancement critical. Russian interests served by preventing incident that could destabilize region.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Sazonov read it three times.</p>
    <p>The final sentence struck him: <em>Russian interests served by preventing incident.</em></p>
    <p>The Belgrade station chief genuinely believed that. He'd assessed based on conventional wisdom: regional stability served Russian interests, therefore preventing assassination served Russian interests.</p>
    <p>He didn't understand that Sazonov had been working from different assumptions entirely.</p>
    <p>Sazonov pulled out secure stationery and began to compose his response. Then stopped. Set down the pen.</p>
    <p>He stood and crossed to the telephone.</p>
    <p>His hand rested on the receiver. The porcelain was cool against his palm.</p>
    <p>He could lift it now. Ask the operator for the Habsburg embassy. Speak to the military attaché. Frame it carefully: "We've received troubling intelligence. Nothing specific, but the climate in the Balkans is particularly volatile. The date of the Archduke's visit—June 28th—carries symbolic weight. Perhaps additional security precautions might be warranted."</p>
    <p>They would listen. Vienna's intelligence wasn't as comprehensive as Russia's. They would take it seriously. They would tighten security. Change the route. Add guards. Perhaps cancel the visit entirely.</p>
    <p>Franz Ferdinand would live.</p>
    <p>His hand tightened on the receiver.</p>
    <p>Franz Ferdinand would live, and his reforms would proceed, and the Slavic populations would find their future within a federalized Habsburg structure, and Russia's protective role would diminish into historical memory.</p>
    <p>His hand remained on the receiver but did not lift it.</p>
    <p>If he made this call, everything he'd positioned for would evaporate. The frameworks. The contingencies. The careful preparation for the moment when Habsburg weakness created Russian opportunity.</p>
    <p>One phone call would prevent all of it.</p>
    <p>He stood there for a long moment, hand on the receiver, feeling its coolness against his palm.</p>
    <p>Then he released it and stepped back.</p>
    <p>He returned to his desk and picked up the pen.</p>

  <div class="ir-body">
    <p>Your assessment noted. However, recommendation for Habsburg advisory declined:</p>
    <p>1. Habsburg security arrangements remain internal Vienna concern.</p>
    <p>2. Advisory would position Russia as protecting Austrian interests over Serbian sovereignty.</p>
    <p>3. Black Hand operations represent internal Balkan dynamics beyond Russian control.</p>
    <p>4. Russian capacity to respond to regional instability better demonstrated through effective crisis management than through prevention of internal Balkan tensions.</p>
    <p>Continue monitoring. Report results. Do not initiate contact with Serbian or Habsburg authorities.</p>
    <p>All intelligence regarding this matter to be routed exclusively through secure channels. Standard distribution suspended.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>He sealed it for cipher transmission—the kind that left no copies, no distribution records.</p>
    <p>He had received specific intelligence about a specific threat to a specific person on a specific date.</p>
    <p>And he had explicitly ordered his intelligence service not to warn the targets.</p>
    <p>More than that: he had ordered all intelligence restricted to secure channels—meaning there would be no broader Russian government awareness, no chance some well-meaning minister might warn Vienna independently.</p>
    <p>Russian silence would be complete.</p>
    <p>Sazonov opened his private notebook. He wrote carefully:</p>
  </div>

<div class="private-note">
  <div class="pn-head">Personal Note · 10th June 1914</div>
  <p>Received intelligence regarding threat to Habsburg heir. Assessment: credible, imminent, high probability. Recommendation from station: warn Vienna.</p>
  <p>Decision: maintain non-interference posture. Habsburg security is Vienna's responsibility. Russian intervention would create complications.</p>
  <p>These are sufficient reasons.</p>
  <p>They must be.</p>
</div>


  <div class="prose">
    <p>He read it once, then locked it away.</p>
    <p>The undetectable crime is the one mistaken for misfortune.</p>
    <p>In eighteen days, he would discover whether his framework would activate as designed.</p>
    <p>On June 15th, a routine bulletin arrived from the Habsburg Foreign Ministry: the summer schedule of imperial visits.</p>
    <p>Among the entries:</p>
    <p><em>28th–29th June: Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie to inspect military maneuvers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ceremonial visit to Sarajevo on 28th June. Open cars along Appel Quay.</em></p>
    <p>Sazonov stared at it.</p>
    <p>June 28th. Vidovdan. St. Vitus Day—the anniversary of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, the most sacred and traumatic date in Serbian national consciousness.</p>
    <p>And the Habsburg heir would parade through Sarajevo in open cars on that day.</p>
    <p>It was inconceivable that Habsburg security hadn't recognized the risk.</p>
    <p>Unless they simply didn't know.</p>
    <p>Because no intelligence service had warned them.</p>
    <p>Sazonov drafted a reply: <em>The Foreign Ministry acknowledges notification of imperial visits. We wish the Archduke safe travels and a productive tour.</em></p>
    <p>He signed it and sent it through routine channels.</p>
    <p>Then he sat in his office as June advanced toward the 28th, and the countdown began.</p>
    <p>Eighteen days had become thirteen.</p>
    <p>Thirteen became seven.</p>
    <p>And Sazonov watched the calendar pages turn, aware that he had crossed from observation into something else—not quite causation, but no longer innocent positioning either.</p>
    <p>The rationalization held.</p>
    <p>For now.</p>
