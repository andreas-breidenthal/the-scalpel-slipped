    <p>My advisor, Professor Claire Duval, specialized in nineteenth-century Russian diplomatic history. Her office at the Sorbonne was a vertical archive—stacks of books on every surface, documents in folders, microfilm boxes stacked in columns that seemed to breathe when the window was open.</p>
    <p>I'd emailed the previous evening: <em>Need to show you something. Important.</em></p>
    <p>Her response came at 7 AM: <em>My office, 9:30. This better not be about chapter revisions.</em></p>
    <p>When I arrived, she poured us both coffee from a machine that looked older than me.</p>
    <p>"So. What's important enough to interrupt my summer reading?"</p>
    <p>I removed the notebook from its folder and placed it on her desk.</p>
    <p>She picked it up carefully, opened it, her eyes narrowing slightly as she read.</p>
    <p>"Where did you get this?"</p>
    <p>"A secondhand bookshop. In Provence."</p>
    <p>"How much did you pay?"</p>
    <p>"Two euros."</p>
    <p>She made a sound that might have been a laugh. Set the notebook down and opened her laptop to a folder of scanned documents. She brought up a diplomatic memorandum from 1913, signed by Sazonov. Large, formal signature.</p>
    <p>Then she held a notebook page next to the screen.</p>
    <p>We both stared.</p>
    <p>The handwriting matched. Not perfectly—personal notes versus official documents—but the underlying characteristics were identical. The way the Cyrillic 'с' curved. The slight rightward lean. The flourishes on capital letters.</p>
    <p>"Well," she said quietly. "That's interesting."</p>
    <p>"Could it be forged?"</p>
    <p>"Possible. But why forge something this specific?" She turned more pages, reading fragments. "If you wanted to forge a Sazonov document for money, you'd forge something dramatic. A secret treaty. Assassination orders. This is..." She paused. "This is confessional. Private. Who would forge a confession that doesn't confess anything illegal, just ethical failure?"</p>
    <p>"So you think it's genuine?"</p>
    <p>"I think we need Dr. Roussel."</p>
    <p>Émilie Roussel ran the conservation lab at the Bibliothèque nationale. I'd met her at a conference two years earlier—her presentation on dating techniques had fascinated me and put half the audience to sleep.</p>
    <p>Duval called her. She arrived an hour later, carrying a portable microscope and a suspicious expression.</p>
    <p>In Duval's office, with the three of us crowded around the desk, she examined the notebook under magnification.</p>
    <p>"Late nineteenth or early twentieth century," she confirmed after ten minutes. "Paper stock consistent with Russian manufacture, probably 1890 to 1920. Cotton rag content, high quality. Government-grade."</p>
    <p>"Can you be more specific?"</p>
    <p>She adjusted the microscope. "Look at the watermark."</p>
    <p>I leaned in. Faint but visible: a double-headed eagle.</p>
    <p>"Imperial Russian government paper," she said. "Used for official purposes and sold to senior officials for personal use. After 1917, nearly impossible to obtain. So our window is pre-revolutionary."</p>
    <p>"And the ink?"</p>
    <p>She selected a page carefully, used fiber-optic light to examine it. "Iron gall ink. Standard for the period. Notice the brownish tinge? That's genuine oxidation. Takes decades to develop. You can't fake it convincingly."</p>
    <p>"So it's period-appropriate?"</p>
    <p>"Materials are period-appropriate, yes. That doesn't prove provenance, but it rules out modern forgery." She photographed the watermark, the paper fibers, the ink patterns. "Andreas, I have to ask—if this is what you think it is, there will be questions about chain of custody. How it left Russia. How it ended up in France. Whether it was legally exported."</p>
    <p>"Probably brought out during the emigration after 1917. Thousands of Russians fled to France."</p>
    <p>"Probably. But you'll need corroborating evidence. If the notebook claims intelligence reports existed, and you can find those reports in archives, that authenticates the contents even if some question the notebook's provenance."</p>
    <p>She handed it back, wrapped in acid-free paper. "You've got something real here. The question is: what do you do with it?"</p>
    <p>I spent the next week in my apartment cross-referencing the notebook against every published source I could access.</p>
    <p>The notebook mentioned specific reports from Belgrade Station: April 2nd about Black Hand capabilities, May intelligence about weapons transfers, June 10th with details about Franz Ferdinand's Sarajevo visit.</p>
    <p>I found nothing in published collections. Which proved nothing—intelligence reports were classified, many lost during the revolution, archives reorganized multiple times.</p>
    <p>But every verifiable fact in the notebook was accurate: Franz Ferdinand's announcement of the visit, the date being Vidovdan, Sazonov's dismissal in July 1916, the July Crisis timeline matching diplomatic records exactly.</p>
    <p>Either this was an extraordinarily sophisticated forgery by someone with deep knowledge of the period, or it was genuine.</p>
    <p>I booked a flight to Moscow.</p>
    <p>The night before departure, I emailed Duval:</p>
    <p><em>I've authenticated as best I can from Paris. Paper, ink, handwriting—all consistent. Now I need to find the intelligence reports he mentions. If they exist, this is real. If I find them, what do I do?</em></p>
    <p>Her response came at 2 AM:</p>
    <p><em>Andreas, you're asking the wrong question. The question isn't what to do IF you find evidence. It's what you'll do WHEN you find it, because I suspect you will. Sazonov was meticulous. If he documented receiving intelligence, that intelligence existed. And bureaucracies keep records even when they shouldn't. Find the evidence first. Then we'll talk about what it means. Be careful in Moscow.</em></p>
    <p>I read her email three times, then closed my laptop and stared at the notebook on my desk.</p>
    <p>Somewhere in Moscow, in archives I'd never accessed, there might be documents proving Sazonov had known, had chosen, had enabled.</p>
    <p>Or there might be nothing.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I would begin searching for ghosts.</p>
