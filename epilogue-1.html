    <p>The funeral was small.</p>
    <p>A few dozen Russian émigrés stood in cold sunshine outside the Orthodox church in Nice, listening to prayers in Old Church Slavonic, watching as Sazonov's coffin was carried to the Cimetière du Château.</p>
    <p>Among them stood Dmitri Gordeyev, the young historian who had interviewed Sazonov the year before.</p>
    <p>He'd been hoping to interview the former Foreign Minister again, to press some of the questions that had seemed evasive in their first conversation. There had been gaps in Sazonov's account—not lies exactly, but carefully constructed absences, places where the narrative seemed to skip over details that might have mattered.</p>
    <p>Now it was too late.</p>
    <p>Gordeyev wondered, briefly, if Sazonov had taken secrets to his grave. But without evidence, without documents, the wondering led nowhere.</p>
    <p>The investigation ended before it began.</p>
    <p>The obituaries were respectful but brief:</p>

  <div class="ir-body">
    <p>Sergei Dmitrievich Sazonov, who served as Foreign Minister of Imperial Russia from 1910 to 1916, died yesterday at his home in Nice, France. He was 67. Sazonov served during the critical years before the Great War and was instrumental in Russia's diplomatic positioning during that period. He was dismissed in 1916 during wartime reorganization and lived in exile after the Bolshevik Revolution. His memoirs, published earlier this year, provide valuable insight into the July Crisis of 1914. Funeral services will be held at the Russian Orthodox Church in Nice.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>That was all.</p>
    <p>No mention of frameworks or positioning. No suggestion he bore responsibility for the war. No investigation into whether his preparation had been too convenient, his response too ready, his knowledge too comprehensive for someone allegedly caught off guard.</p>
    <p>The questions simply weren't asked.</p>
    <p>Because by 1927, the narrative was fixed: Germany's aggression, the alliance system, mobilization schedules, the failure of diplomacy. A perfect storm of miscalculation and bad luck.</p>
    <p>No one was looking for the man who'd helped create conditions for that storm.</p>
    <p>No one was examining drawers that had long since been emptied.</p>
    <p>No one was requesting encrypted messages from Belgrade Station that had been lost in revolutionary chaos.</p>
    <p>No one was asking why Russian intelligence had been so carefully positioned to respond to a crisis they supposedly hadn't anticipated.</p>
    <p>Sazonov was buried in the Cimetière du Château in Nice, in a modest grave marked only with his name and dates:</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Inconsolata',monospace; font-size:0.8rem; color:var(--mist); margin-top:0.5rem;">1860 – 1927</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>No epitaph. No tribute. Just a name and the years that bracketed a life.</p>
    <p>A few people visited in the weeks after the funeral. Then the visitors stopped coming. The grave became just another marker in a cemetery full of Russian exiles, all mourning a world that no longer existed.</p>
    <p>The Mediterranean waves continued their eternal rhythm, indifferent to the secrets buried in that earth.</p>
    <p>The archives remain.</p>
    <p>In Moscow, Vienna, Berlin, London—scattered across institutions that survived empires and revolutions—the documents sit in their files.</p>
    <p>Each one innocuous. Each one defensible. Each one explaining nothing by itself.</p>
    <p>But together, for anyone who knew to look, for anyone who asked the right questions, they would tell a story.</p>
    <p>None of these documents prove conspiracy.</p>
    <p>Each is ambiguous, explicable, defensible.</p>
    <p>But taken together—if anyone ever assembled them, if anyone ever asked the right questions, if anyone ever connected the dots across archives in different countries using different languages and different filing systems—they form a pattern.</p>
    <p>A pattern of intelligence received and not shared.</p>
    <p>A pattern of positioning that preceded crisis.</p>
    <p>A pattern of frameworks activated too smoothly, too quickly, as though prepared in advance.</p>
    <p>A pattern suggesting that the "accident" of 1914 was something more complicated than accident, something less innocent than miscalculation.</p>
    <p>But no historian has assembled them.</p>
    <p>No researcher has asked the questions that would reveal the pattern.</p>
    <p>Because the questions themselves are unthinkable.</p>
    <p>The established narrative—alliance systems, mobilization schedules, structural inevitability—is too powerful, too convenient, too comforting to challenge.</p>
    <p>It absolves everyone by blaming systems rather than choices, mechanism rather than men, inevitability rather than decisions made in specific rooms by specific people at specific moments when other choices were available.</p>
    <p>And so the evidence sits in archives under misleading classifications, unread and unconnected, waiting for someone to look.</p>
    <p>The perfect crime is the one that looks like accident.</p>
    <p>And Sazonov's crime looked so much like accident that history never thought to investigate.</p>
    <p>Did the scalpel slip?</p>
    <p>Or was it pushed?</p>
    <p>History has no answer.</p>
    <p>Because history never asked the question.</p>
    <p>And the man who could have answered it died on Christmas morning, 1927, in a rented room overlooking the Mediterranean, taking his secrets with him into silence—leaving behind only scattered documents that no one would ever assemble, a notebook that no one would ever read, and a pattern that no one would ever recognize.</p>
    <p>The undetectable crime, perfected.</p>
    <p>Not through cleverness or elaborate conspiracy, but through the simplest method of all: silence.</p>
    <p>Chosen deliberately, maintained systematically, carried faithfully to the grave.</p>
    <p>We will never know.</p>
    <p>Because he made sure we wouldn't.</p>

    <p>At least, that should have been the end.</p>
    <p>Would have remained the end—the silence preserved, the truth buried with Sazonov in a Nice cemetery—if I hadn't walked into a second-hand bookshop in Saint-Paul-de-Vence on a June afternoon in 2025.</p>
