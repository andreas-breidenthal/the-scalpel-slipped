  <div class="prose">
    <p>A young Russian émigré named Dmitri Gordeyev came to interview Sazonov for a historical study of the July Crisis.</p>
    <p>Sazonov answered the door himself—he had no servants, couldn't afford them—and was struck immediately by the young man's intensity. Early thirties, thin, wearing clothes that had been good once but showed signs of age and careful mending. The look of an émigré intellectual, surviving on passion and diminishing resources.</p>
    <p>"Foreign Minister, thank you for seeing me," Gordeyev said in careful Russian, the accent marking him as Moscow-born.</p>
    <p>"I am not Foreign Minister," Sazonov replied. "That title died in another country. I am simply Sergei Dmitrievich."</p>
    <p>They sat in Sazonov's small apartment. The afternoon light slanted through the window, catching dust motes in the air, laying bars of gold across the worn carpet. The room was spare—a few books on a shelf, a desk cluttered with papers, two mismatched chairs that had come with the apartment. The modest accumulation of an exile's life. Through the window, the Mediterranean sparkled in autumn light, indifferent to the conversations of displaced Russians.</p>
    <p>Sazonov poured tea from a pot that had grown tepid while they'd been talking. His hand was steady, but he noticed he was pouring more carefully than necessary, watching the stream of dark liquid as though it required his full attention.</p>
    <p>Gordeyev had prepared questions, written in a notebook with neat, precise handwriting. He consulted it frequently, making small notations as Sazonov spoke.</p>
    <p>"You were uniquely positioned to observe the crisis unfold," he began. "Looking back, do you believe war was inevitable?"</p>
    <p>Sazonov considered his response carefully. The young man was intelligent—you could see it in his eyes, the way he listened, the precision of his questions. Every word would matter.</p>
    <p>"Inevitable is a dangerous word," Sazonov said finally. "It suggests no choices existed. Choices always exist. The question is whether anyone recognizes them in time."</p>
    <p>"Some have suggested that various governments received warnings about nationalist activity in the Balkans," Gordeyev said, his pen poised over the notebook. "Do you recall any such reports reaching the Foreign Ministry?"</p>
    <p>The question hung in the air.</p>
    <p>Sazonov felt his hands tighten slightly on his teacup. The porcelain was warm against his palms—too warm suddenly, uncomfortable. He set it down carefully on the small table between them, making sure it was centered on the saucer.</p>
    <p>"All powers received general intelligence about Balkan instability," Sazonov said. His voice was steady, he was sure of that. "Serbian nationalism was no secret. The Black Hand's existence was known. But specific warnings? The kind that might have prevented Sarajevo?" He shook his head slowly. "Nothing that specific reached my desk."</p>
    <p>The lie came easily now. He'd practiced it in his mind for twelve years, refined the phrasing, perfected the tone—regretful but certain, the voice of a man with nothing to hide.</p>
    <p>Gordeyev made notes, his pen scratching across paper. The sound seemed very loud in the small room.</p>
    <p>"And the positioning before the crisis?" he continued. "Some historians suggest Russia was remarkably prepared to respond, almost as if—"</p>
    <p>"As if we'd anticipated it?" Sazonov smiled thinly. He reached for his teacup again, then changed his mind and folded his hands in his lap instead. "Young man, preparing for Balkan crisis was not prescience. It was common sense. The region had been unstable for decades. The Habsburg grip was weakening. Any competent Foreign Ministry maintained contingency plans. That's not anticipation—that's basic statecraft."</p>
    <p>"But the speed of Russian mobilization—"</p>
    <p>"Was necessity, not design." Sazonov's voice took on an edge. He could hear it himself, and wondered if Gordeyev heard it too. "When Austria moved against Serbia, we had no choice. Protecting the Slavs was Russia's moral obligation. That we were prepared to fulfill that obligation should be seen as credit, not suspicion."</p>
    <p>He stood abruptly—the chair scraped against the floor—and walked to the window. He needed movement, needed to be somewhere other than sitting under that steady gaze. Outside, the promenade was busy with afternoon strollers. An old woman fed pigeons. A couple walked arm in arm. Ordinary life, continuing.</p>
    <p>"I've also been corresponding with other diplomats from that period," Gordeyev said behind him. "A man who served at Belgrade Station has been particularly helpful. He remembers quite a bit about the intelligence work in 1914. Some interesting details about threat assessments and reporting protocols."</p>
    <p>Sazonov felt something cold move through his chest. He kept his back to the young man, staring out at the Mediterranean, giving himself a moment before responding.</p>
    <p>"Belgrade Station did valuable work," he said carefully. "All our stations did. But intelligence work is always fragmented. One station's reports might suggest patterns that weren't visible to anyone else. That's the nature of the work."</p>
    <p>"Of course." More scratching of pen on paper. "Though he mentioned something about channels for sensitive material—reports that went directly to the Foreign Minister rather than through regular distribution. Do you recall such arrangements?"</p>
    <p>There it was. The question beneath the question.</p>
    <p>Sazonov turned from the window, keeping his face composed. "Security classification has always been part of intelligence work. Some material required discretion. But I couldn't possibly comment on specific protocols from that time—it would be irresponsible, even now."</p>
    <p>He returned to his chair, sat down, arranged himself carefully. Gordeyev was watching him, and Sazonov wondered what the young man saw. An old diplomat, cautious about revealing tradecraft? Or something else—someone evading, deflecting, hiding?</p>
    <p>"Forgive me, Sergei Dmitrievich," Gordeyev said, his tone shifting slightly. "But you speak of the crisis as if it unfolded according to forces no one controlled. Yet you also speak of choices and contingency plans. Which was it? Uncontrollable forces or human decisions?"</p>
    <p>It was the most penetrating question anyone had ever asked him.</p>
    <p>The most dangerous question.</p>
    <p>Sazonov's throat felt dry. He reached for his teacup, lifted it, took a small sip of the tepid tea. The taste was bitter. He'd forgotten to add sugar.</p>
    <p>"Both," he said finally. "The forces were real—nationalism, alliance systems, mobilization schedules. Momentum that accumulated over decades. But within those forces, men made choices. Some chose wisely. Some chose foolishly. Some chose not to choose, believing neutrality was possible." He paused. "And some, perhaps, recognized that the machinery was in motion and positioned themselves to survive when it crashed."</p>
    <p>"And which were you?"</p>
    <p>Sazonov met his eyes.</p>
    <p>"I was," he said slowly, "a man trying to protect Russian interests in circumstances I did not create and could not fully control."</p>
    <p>It was the most honest thing he'd said in the entire interview.</p>
    <p>It was also the most carefully crafted lie.</p>
    <p>Because he had created circumstances, or at least enabled them. He had chosen not to prevent what he could have prevented. He had positioned not to survive the crash but to benefit from it.</p>
    <p>But Gordeyev, taking notes, heard only an old diplomat acknowledging the complexity of history.</p>
    <p>They spoke for another half hour—about Wilhelm's temperament, Nicholas's indecision, the telegram exchanges during the July Crisis, the moment when diplomacy died and military necessity took over.</p>
    <p>Sazonov answered carefully, revealing texture without truth, providing color without confession. But he found himself touching his teacup repeatedly without drinking, his fingers tracing the rim, needing the familiar shape, the solid reality of porcelain.</p>
    <p>When Gordeyev finally stood to leave, he closed his notebook and tucked it into his worn leather satchel.</p>
    <p>"One more question, if I may. Do you have regrets? About decisions made, or not made, during your time as Foreign Minister?"</p>
    <p>Sazonov looked at the young man, this earnest scholar trying to understand catastrophe, trying to find meaning in horror, trying to assign responsibility in ways that might prevent future catastrophes.</p>
    <p>"I regret," Sazonov said carefully, "that wiser men than I did not make the decisions that needed to be made."</p>
    <p>It was true, as far as it went.</p>
    <p>It was also insufficient to the weight of what he carried.</p>
    <p>Gordeyev paused at the door, his hand on the frame. "I appreciate your time, Sergei Dmitrievich. Your perspective has been invaluable. I'll send you a copy of my paper when it's complete, if you'd like."</p>
    <p>"That would be kind."</p>
    <p>After the door closed, Sazonov stood in the center of his small apartment, listening to Gordeyev's footsteps recede down the stairs. Three flights. He counted them. Then the sound of the street door opening and closing.</p>
    <p>The interview had lasted ninety minutes. It felt like much longer.</p>
    <p>Sazonov found himself moving without conscious decision. He picked up the teacups—both of them, though Gordeyev had barely touched his—and carried them to the tiny kitchen. He washed them carefully, methodically, using more soap than necessary. Dried them with a cloth until they shone. Put them away in the cabinet, making sure they were aligned perfectly with the other cups.</p>
    <p>Then he returned to the main room and began straightening. The books on the shelf—already neat but he arranged them again, largest to smallest. The papers on his desk—already organized but he tapped them into even more precise stacks. The small rug—he bent down and smoothed a wrinkle that wasn't really there.</p>
    <p>His hands needed something to do. Some task that felt like control.</p>
    <p>He swept the floor, though it wasn't dirty. Wiped down the windowsill, though there was barely any dust. Adjusted the position of his chair, moving it an inch to the left, then back to the right, then back to exactly where it had been.</p>
    <p>Anything to avoid sitting still with the questions that had been asked.</p>
    <p><em>Belgrade Station has been particularly helpful. Some interesting details about threat assessments and reporting protocols.</em></p>
    <p>How much did this Belgrade Station survivor remember? What had he told Gordeyev? <em>Reports that went directly to the Foreign Minister</em>—how much detail had he provided?</p>
    <p>Sazonov forced himself to stop moving. He was being ridiculous. The man probably remembered nothing specific. Just general procedures. And even if he did, what could he prove? The documents were gone. Burned. The paper trail sanitized.</p>
    <p>Nothing connected him to anything more than prudent contingency planning.</p>
    <p>He was safe.</p>
    <p>The young man hadn't pressed. He'd accepted the explanations. Written them down. Thanked him politely.</p>
    <p>But the questions had been asked.</p>
    <p>And Sazonov understood, with sudden clarity standing in his tidy apartment with the autumn light fading outside, that somewhere, someone might be assembling pieces. Maybe not Gordeyev—he was young, earnest, probably wouldn't see the pattern. But someday, someone might.</p>
    <p>Someone with access to archives he'd thought sanitized. Someone who knew to look for documents filed under misleading headings. Someone who might interview enough survivors to connect fragments into a whole.</p>
    <p>The perfect crime required perfect silence.</p>
    <p>And silence, he was learning, required constant vigilance.</p>
    <p>He stood at his window for a long time, watching the sun set over the Mediterranean. The light turned the water gold, then orange, then purple. The promenade emptied as families went home for dinner. The pigeons settled into their roosts.</p>
    <p>The interview had shaken him more than he'd expected.</p>
    <p>For twelve years, he'd lived with his choices. For twelve years, he'd carried the weight of knowledge that millions had died in a war he might have prevented—or at least delayed, complicated, made less likely.</p>
    <p>But until today, he'd never had to defend those choices aloud to someone intelligent enough to see the gaps in his story, educated enough to know what questions mattered.</p>
    <p>Gordeyev hadn't pressed. But he'd noticed things. The way Sazonov's hands had tightened on the teacup. The way he'd stood abruptly and gone to the window. The careful precision of his answers, the practiced quality of his evasions.</p>
    <p>The young man was intelligent. He would think about those things later, in his room, reviewing his notes. He would wonder about the pauses, the deflections, the places where Sazonov's narrative seemed to skip over details that might have mattered.</p>
    <p>He might not understand what he was seeing. But he was seeing something.</p>
    <p>And that was dangerous.</p>
    <p>Finally, as full darkness fell outside, Sazonov crossed to his bedroom and retrieved the small safe from the closet. His hands trembled slightly as he worked the combination.</p>
    <p>Inside was the leather-bound notebook.</p>
    <p>He should destroy it. Now. Tonight. Burn it as he'd burned everything else twelve years ago in Petrograd.</p>
    <p>He carried it to the kitchen and set it on the counter beside the gas stove. Found the matches. Struck one, watching the flame flare bright in the dim kitchen.</p>
    <p>The smell of sulfur filled the air.</p>
    <p>He held the flame near the notebook's cover.</p>
    <p>The leather began to darken slightly from the heat.</p>
    <p>But he couldn't do it.</p>
    <p>This was the only evidence his calculations had been real, that his framework had existed, that he had not been merely a passenger in history but someone who had tried—however catastrophically—to steer it.</p>
    <p>Without this notebook, he was just an old diplomat who'd made reasonable decisions in unreasonable times.</p>
    <p>With it, he was something else.</p>
    <p>The man who'd known and chosen silence.</p>
    <p>The man who'd positioned and watched others light the fuse.</p>
    <p>The man whose hands might not have pulled any trigger but had ensured no one warned the target.</p>
    <p>The match burned down to his fingers. He dropped it in the sink, watched it hiss out.</p>
    <p>He stood in his dark kitchen, the notebook in his hands, wondering which version of himself he wanted to be remembered as.</p>
    <p>Or whether he wanted to be remembered at all.</p>
    <p>Outside, the Mediterranean was invisible now, just a sound—the eternal rhythm of waves against shore, indifferent to the secrets carried by old men, indifferent to the questions that might never be answered, indifferent to the weight of choices made in silence and carried alone.</p>
    <p>Sazonov locked the notebook back in the safe. Returned the safe to the closet. Sat in his chair by the window in the darkness, unable to turn on the lamp, unable to move.</p>
    <p>The world he'd known was gone.</p>
    <p>The world he'd helped destroy.</p>
    <p>And he was still here, carrying secrets that would die with him, wondering if that death would come as relief or as the final, irrevocable failure—the truth locked away forever, the questions never answered, the millions dead in a war that history would forever call an accident.</p>
    <p>When he finally rose to light the lamp, his legs were stiff from sitting motionless for so long. The match trembled in his hand. The flame took three attempts to catch.</p>
    <p>He made himself tea—fresh tea, not the bitter dregs from the afternoon—and sat at his desk with paper and pen, trying to write something, anything, to occupy his mind.</p>
    <p>But the page remained blank.</p>
    <p>And outside, the Mediterranean continued its rhythm, wave after wave, wearing away the shore grain by grain, patient and relentless and utterly indifferent to the burdens carried by men who'd outlived their world and their certainties, who'd made choices they could never unmake, who'd crossed lines they could never uncross.</p>
    <p>The silence endured.</p>
    <p>And with it, the fear that someday, someone would ask the right questions.</p>
    <p>And the hope—perhaps—that they would.</p>
